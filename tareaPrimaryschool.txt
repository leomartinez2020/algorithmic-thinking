The file contains a tab-separated list representing the active contacts during 20-second intervals of the
data collection. Each line has the form t i j Ci Cj, where i and j are the anonymous IDs of the persons
in contact, Ci and Cj are their classes, and the interval during which this contact was active is [t âˆ’ 20s,t],
where the time t is measured in seconds. If multiple contacts are active in a given interval, you will see
multiple lines starting with the same value of t.

[15 points] Read in the dataset and create a static network according to the following specifications: The
edge weight between two nodes should be proportional to the number of measured contacts.

[15 points] Compute and plot the degree distribution of the network. Do the same for the clustering
coefficient and the betweenness centrality.

[10 points] Use the spring force layout to plot the graph, with node sizes proportional to the node degree,
and node colors given by the class labels.
