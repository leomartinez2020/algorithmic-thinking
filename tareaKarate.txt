[10 points] Consider the Karate club network. Compute the degree, eigenvector, closeness, betweeness
and Katz centrality (with the default value provided by networkx) of each node. Use networkx functions!
Produce one plot per centrality measure

[10 points] Compute the second eigenvector of the Laplacian matrix of the Karate club network. Assign
nodes into clusters according to their signs of this vector, and plot the nodes in each cluster with a different
color.
