Input: Undirected graph g = (V, e)
Output: CC: the set of connected components of graph g

1. RemainingNodes <-- V
2. CC <-- {}
3. while RemainingNodes != {} do
4.   Let i be ans arbitrary node in RemainingNodes
5.   W <-- BFS-VISITED(...)
6.   CC <-- . . .
7.   RemainingNodes <-- . . .
8. return CC

cc_visited(ugraph) - Takes the undirected graph ugraph and returns a list of sets, 
where each set consists of all the nodes (and nothing else) in a connected component, 
and there is exactly one set in the list for each connected component in ugraph and nothing else.

largest_cc_size(ugraph) - Takes the undirected graph ugraph and returns the size (an integer) 
of the largest connected component in ugraph.

To ensure an efficient implementation of cc_visited, we recommend that you use the function 
bfs_visited in implementing cc_visited
