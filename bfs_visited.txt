Input: Undirected graph g = (V, E); source node i

Output: Visited: the set of all nodes visited by the algotithm

1. Initialize Q to an empty queue
2. Visited <-- {i}
3. enqueue(Q, i)
4. while Q is not empty do
5.   j <-- dequeue(Q)
6.   foreach neighbor h of j do
7.     if h not in Visited then
8.       Visited <-- Visited union {h}
9.       enqueue(Q, h)
10. return Visited
